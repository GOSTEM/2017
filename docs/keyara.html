 </h2>Personal Statement - Keyara Gayle </h2>
<p>
   The sea is the world’s oldest and most complex ecosystem which in my mind is reason enough to want to learn more about it.
I possess a drive and passion to get through the tough times. Like all scientists, I have a natural  scientific ability. I am patient, observant, curious, precise, and analytical. I have the ability to work alone and the grit to do demanding and repetitive physical labor in remote locations. Scientists must have a natural love for the outdoors but can acquire the necessary math, science, and communication skills. Above all though I have a love and appreciation for the ocean.

<p><h2>  From the early age of 10 I knew I wanted a career that involved marine biology and ecology. Having a nature-loving parents really sparked my interest in biology. From catching frogs in the  swamp behind our house to finding land hermit crabs on the beach in Florida. My mom has always shown me that if you look closely,  you will find much more than what first meets the eye. In terms of my aspirations, I am interested in conservation and welfare and would eventually like to be working to diagnose disease and prevent outbreaks in both wild and captive populations.
