    <p>Welcome to my webpage!! This is where I'll be posting a bit about myself.</p>
    <p>I coded this website with the teachings of Go! Stem. Thank you to everyone who has helped.</p>
  <section class="about">
  <h1>About ME!!!</h1>
  <img class="profile-img" width="300px"height="auto" src="http://i.imgur.com/NwXOU60.jpg">
  <p>My name is Prokrithy, which means nature! I come from a Bengali background,and
    grew up in the inner city of Toronto.</p>
  <p>I have always been interested in writing, but as I got older I got more interrested in the sciences, especially coding!</p>
  <p>I have also been done 3 years of an after school art camp, so my creative side will always live within me.</p>
  <p>I'm 14 years old, and I am a Taurus. Astrology is super fun to me, but I don't take it seriously. </p>

<section class="loves">
  <h1>A few things I love!!</h1>
  <p>As I have mentioned previously, I have always been interested in art and writing, as well as astorlogy.</p>
  <p>For the basics, my current favourite show is Brooklyn Nine-Nine and my all time favourite books are the Percy Jackson series.</p>
  <p>Although I haven't been to many countries, I would love to travel! I even have a list of places I'd like to go one day.</p>
  <p>Toronto has always been my home and I love it very much, but I would love to move to New york city one day.</p>
