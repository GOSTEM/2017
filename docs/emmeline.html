      <h1> About Me </h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Emmeline Berger. I'm 15 years old, and I am a Junior at Ursula Franklin Academy.</p>

      <h1> I Love... </h1>
      <p> I love to do many things, but most importantly I love to figure skate, bake, and play soccer. </p>
      <p> I've been figure skating since I was 4 years old, and my first competition was when I was 7 years old.<br>
        Here's a picture of me with my coach before going on the ice for my first competition:<br>
        <img class="comp" src="http://i.imgur.com/8b4bt9P.jpg" width="400" height="550"> <br>
        I still skate today, and I'm currently in the process of becoming coach-certified.<br>
        Another one of my favourite sports is soccer. I have been playing soccer for 4 years, and my school team qualified for OFSAA (provincials) this past year!<br>
        Here's a picture of us after winning our first game! <br>

        I also love to make and decorate baked goods,<br>
        Like these cookies,<br>

        And this German cheesecake. <br>

        One of my dreams for the future is to open up a bakery, because it combines my passion for baking and my interest in becoming a small business owner/entrepreneur.<br>
        To do this, I plan on getting a degree in business administration or management, so that I would be capable of owning my own business without problem.<br>
