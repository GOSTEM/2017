  <h2> Sad Kermit </h2>

 <p> The Sad Kermit meme came late 2016, orginating from the Twitter user @johnnysun's twitter. He put the caption of: "when u give urself a gentle hug evrey night before u go to bed, reassuring urself that no mater wat, the day was yours bc u chose to live it." The user then asked others to do the same with people joining in innocently in the fun. However when the meme reached other people's hand, the meme took a darker turn. Users like @AndrewChamings took a darker twist to the meme when he tweeted: "when you realize that your daughter is now too big to hold without it looking silly, and you will never pick her up again." Other users like @_benn_n has made the meme way to realistic saying: "when you realise your nothing but a tiny speck in the universe and hug to reassure your self that your life means something". The Sad Kermit Meme took a sad turn.</p>
