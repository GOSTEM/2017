      <h1> Dance!! </h1>
      <br>
      <p> To start off One of my biggest passions is Dance. I Dance regularly and always enjoy and </p>
      <p> look forward to learning something new in every class. I dance all styles including tap, jazz, acro, lyrical, </P>
        <p> hip hop, and musical theater. I think I enjoy dance so much because it gives me so much joy when I'm dancing </p>
        <p> and I get this feeling that dance was meant for me and that it is a way for me to escape the real world and forget about </P>
          <p> any stress or worries I may have. </p>

          <p> One of the other things I really love is food. I enjoy trying all types of food. I am always open to tasting </p>
          <p> a wide diversity of food. I like to open up my pallet to different options and choices of food like, </p>
          <p> italian, chinese, thai, indian, japanese and greek. One of the main reasons I enjoy trying alot of food</p>
          <p> is because I had heard about different styles off  of the show called Master Chef. I love watching people </p>
          <p> cook and bake all these amazing types of food and think of what It would be like to taste all the food they make. </p>

          <h1> Winter!!</h1>
          <br>
          <p> Winter Is my favorite season. One of the reasons I love winter is because there is SNOW!! People may say that </P>
            <p> they dont like winter because it's cold and you get sick, but I look past that and think of a warm fire with cozy </p>
            <p> socks and hot chocolate. I also like winter because my birthday occurs in that season. Yes, it is cold but that just </p>
            <p> gives you more reasons to wrap up in a blanket on a cold winter night, grab your popcorn and hot beverage and watch a movie </p>
