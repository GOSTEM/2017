      <h1> My Life </h1>
      <p> My name is Claire A. Berger, I turned 14 on July 6th, 2017. I grew up in the junction in Toronto, ON with my two sisters and parents. I have brown hair and eyes. I'm 5ft 4, and still growing!</p>
      <p> I went to St. Cecilia from JK through grade 8 and met my best friends. I joined as many clubs and teams as possible. I was on the cross country and track and field team every year as well as the soccer, vollyball and ultimate frisbee teams. At my graduation I won Female Valedictorian and Female Athlete of the year. My favourite memories were from my elementary school and I'm sad to see it go.</p>
      <p>As a child of 3 girls we were all very involed in after school programs like dance figure skating and soccer. My older sister is a figure skater and was the influence for me to skate as well. I enjoyed it until I was invited to a program at my dance studio which I was attending as well. As we grew older we expanded to soccer in the summer and our little sister followed in our foot steps, joining dance, soccer and figure skating. She was on a competitive soccer team but quit when she was also invited to join the same program as me at our dance studio. She later dropped skating because of her full schedule.  </p>

      <h2> Dance </h2>
      <p>Dance has been a big part of my life since I was little. I started dance at the age of 2, jumping up to join my older sister's class at the community center. Once my mom signed me up I was so excited. After a year of dance at the community center I decided to step it up a notch. I joined a dance studio and have been there ever since, it is my second home. In 2010 I was invited to join a special program called ITP (intensive training program) and have enjoyed every minute of it. This year I was awarded a scholarship given to the student who was the most dedicated to the studio and their progress to their dance. I intend on continuing dance for as long as I can. </p>

      <h2> The Clarinet</h2>
      <p> Starting in grade 7 students are required to choose an instrument for music class because you transfer from vocal to band. You can pick; drums, saxaphone, trombone, baratone, trumpet, flute or in my cass clarinet. I enjoyed band so much I would be jumping the class before. Students can also be invited to the school's all star band in grade 7. I was offered a spot but declined because it would overlap with all my other activities. In grade 8 I was offered again, this time taking it later on in the year after a few of my teams had already competed. I traveled to diffrent schools and festivals to play. I am happy to be continuing music in high school. </p>
